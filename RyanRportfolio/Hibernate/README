This hibernate example is used to introduce and start hibernate on your computer.  BEFORE compiling this code the developer must first
add the external required JAR files to their libraries. they must also configure the mapping file (hibernate.cfg.xml) to suite the needs
of the machine and application or they will recieve a session factory error on their local server. Initially a relational database must 
be completly set up BEFORE executing this code. The author of this repository also assumes that the developer testing this code has 
already installed the latest version of Java and hibernate ORM. If not do that FIRST.
