The use case diagram is used to capture customer requirments. 
Luckily in this case I already know what the customer wants and what the shareholders want so I can immeadiatly 
start diagramming the use case for the motivation app. This case diagram is also very simple because there will be only one customer 
that will be using the app and the rest will be developers and database administrators.
