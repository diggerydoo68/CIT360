This App displays a list of genres to choose from and then it displays a list of bands to choose from.  
When a user chooses, information is displayed on the screen showing a description about one of the musicians in that band. 
It utilizes the while loop and case statement to give the user a list of options to choose from. In this case it gives a selection of bands to choose from and it gives back information depending on the case. The most important thing I learned with this project was how
powerful UML can be for analyzing the internal influences of the software project.
